# JavaCode

Welcome to **JavaCode** — a public repository documenting my journey in mastering the **Java programming language**. This repository contains a variety of code samples, practice exercises, and mini-projects that reflect my ongoing learning and exploration of Java fundamentals and beyond.

## 📌 Purpose 

This repository serves three main goals:

1. 📚 **Practice & Documentation**  
   Systematically record Java programming concepts and hands-on exercises for review and reference.

2. 🧪 **Experimentation**  
   Explore Java features (such as OOP, collections, exceptions, GUI with Swing, multithreading, etc.) through focused, testable code snippets.

3. 🌱 **Continuous Learning**  
   Demonstrate a mindset of continuous improvement and serve as a foundation for larger-scale Java projects in the future.
